    <h2>Projects:</h2>

    The Mural Club has created many works of art around school. We have worked with chalk, window paints, acrylics, and exterior paints.

    <!--Makes a list. Each element must have <li> -->
    <ul>
      <li><a href = "file:///Users/girlswhocode/Desktop/web%20dev/chalkArt.html" > <em>Chalk Art</em> </a> </li>
      <!--Our seasonal chalk art in the cafeteria is changed every few months to reflect the time of year. In the 2017-18 school year, we designed the
      chalk board with 6 different themes: fall, halloween, winter, valentines, spring, and summer. Each of the designs are voted on my club members.-->
