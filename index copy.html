      <strong> Mural Club </strong> at Rocklin High School is a creative group of art-minded students who raise money
      and work with our ASB to make art around the school campus. In the last school year, the mural club consisted
      of 20 members and completed 12 projects. In the next few years, we hope to expand our artwork to the larger
      community of Rocklin. <em>Stay Tuned!</em>

Projects:

The Mural Club has created many works of art around school. We have worked with chalk, window paints, acrylics, and exterior paints.
Chalk Art
Our seasonal chalk art in the cafeteria is changed every few months to reflect the time of year. In the 2017-18 school year, we designed the chalk board with 6 different themes: fall, halloween, winter, valentines, spring, and summer. Each of the designs are voted on my club members.
Homecoming Door Painting
The 2017 Homecoming theme was Pixar movies. The Mural Club was assigned to create decorations for the Homecoming dance
Thunder Galleria Window Painting
Pole Painting
